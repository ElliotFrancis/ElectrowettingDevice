Serial Protocol between main software and arduino

Main Software	Arduino		String				Meaning

			-->				S[x][y]\r\n			Set plate at coordinates x, y, where x and y are integer bytes (command)
			<--				ACK S[x][y]\r\n		Acknowledged plate set command
			-->				C[x][y]\r\n			Clear plate at coordinates x, y, where x and y are integer bytes (command)
			<--				ACK C[x][y]\r\n		Acknowledged plate set command
			-->				CAP\r\n				Clear All Plates (all plates off) (command)
			<--				ACK CAP\r\n			Acknowledged clear all plates command
			-->				VER\r\n				Request for arduino software version number (request)
			<--				V [v].[v].[v]\r\n	Return the version number of the running arduino software
			
All messages from the main software to the Arduino are 3 bytes (chars) long (not including the \n)
All messages from the arduino back to the main software are 7 bytes (chars) long (not including the \n)

All commands from the main software should be answered with an acknowledgement from the arduino that contains the original message

Any requests from the main software are not to be answered with an acknowledgement but with a return message specific to the request
(acknowledgement is not needed because the return message implies acknowledgement instead)

All messages are appended with the \r\n char sequence (2 characters)
All characters in this protocol use upper case
