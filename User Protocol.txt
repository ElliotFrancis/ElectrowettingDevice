This file describes the user input protocol for the program

Each line consists of a single instruction
The protocol is not case sensitive so either upper case or lower case is fine
The protocol runs in sequential order so that the 

All the possible instructions and their functionalities is listed below:

NEW A > 1,1		:	Declares that there is to be a new droplet referred to as A that will be placed on the plates at position 1,1
MIX A B	> C		:	Mixes the two droplets referred to as A and B
SPLIT A > A,B	:	Splits the droplet referred to as A into droplets B and C
WAIT 10			:	The device will wait for 10 seconds before continuing with the sequence
MOVE A > 1,1	:	Move the droplet referred to as A to the position of 1,1 (this only needs to be done if you want the droplet in a specific place)


Any instruction lines that cannot be read, will be flagged and the protocol will not run until the user accepts the errors or fixes the errors.

Droplet names cannot be defined more than once under any circumstance.
When mixing or spliting, the old names are lost until the end of the instruction sequence.

Line breaks can be \r or \n or \r\n. All of which work

Any instruction lines that have a space or tab as the first character or are completely blank will be ignored from the sequence.
In this way you can add comments to the instruction sequence.

There must be a space between the instruction keyword and the first parameter
